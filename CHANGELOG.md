- Tag pages will now show aliased by, implied by and implies on them below the description.
- Added a count of tags at the top of each tag page.

## [0.6.0] - 2016-10-22
## Added
- Parsers can now process messages that span multiple lines. BREAKING Please update your parsers to include SPLITTER
- Ellipsis are now properly stripped for clients that use them in message splitting.([#6x])
- Descriptions added to arcs. Just add arc_description: to one rp's YAML in any particular arc
- Descriptions can be added to RPs. Just add description: to the RP YAML ([#54x])

### Changed
 - OOC text hidden by default on RP pages ([#61x])
 - Arcs now sort to the top of the Acs page (#[21x])
 - Site structure now builds relative links. 
 - Tag File can now be separate from the settings so that changes to tags rebuild the site. ([#53x])

## [0.5.0] - 2016-01-29
### Added
- The default footer has a "Generated by [jekyll-rp_logs](https://github.com/xiagu/jekyll-rp_logs) vX.X.X" blurb in the left column. ([#47x])

### Changed
- Parsers live in `lib/jekyll/rp_logs/parsers/` now. This is purely a development-side change.
- The default theme's timestamps are in their own column on the left now. They revert to being inline when the page width gets too small. Run `rplogs update` to install this change if you haven't changed the non-custom SASS files. ([#60x])
- Instead of needing a Rakefile, this gem now exposes an `rplogs` executable to perform tasks like setting up a new site scaffold. ([#63x])
  - The `rplogs` program is also used to update your installed theme, with `rplogs update`. ([#69x])

### Fixed
- `main.scss` no longer has its executable bits set. ([#67x])

## [0.4.0] - 2016-01-11
### Added
- Tag descriptions can be set in the config file and show up on each tag's page that lists all RPs with that tag. ([#28x])

### Fixed
- The clickable region for the RP titles in the default theme now only covers the text and not a large amount of blank space to the right. ([#59x])
- Error messages for missing index pages (main and arc) improved. ([#56x])

## [0.3.1] - 2015-11-12
### Changed
- Certain characters (`#/\`) are replaced with `_` now instead of a word escape.

### Fixed
- Tag implication and aliasing still work even with `infer_char_tags` turned off. ([#52x])
- Unsafe characters for URLs are replaced with `_` in tags now instead of throwing an exception. ([#48x], [#49x])

## [0.3.0] - 2015-11-06
### Added
- Tags are displayed underneath the title of an RP on its page (requires theme update) ([#37x])
- Tag implications and tag aliases! ([#12x], [#36x])
- Added sample `tag_implications` and `tag_aliases` settings to the default config file
- A test RP for tag implication and aliasing.
- `Tag.[]` method for converting an array of strings into Tags, inspired by `Hash`
- Logs the total number of tag pages generated.
- Logs the total number of RPs converted after processing them.


### Changed
- Calendar icon instead of the word "Started" for start dates (requires theme update)
- `Tag#to_s` returns character tags prefixed with `"char:"`. Use `#name` to get the raw name.
- Cleaned up the tests for `RpLogGenerator` a lot.
- Logging each individual conversion is now debug level output and not info.
- Test RPs now use the `.rp` extension instead of `.md`. This keeps them from being run through the Markdown converter, which saves time!

### Fixed
- Liquid rendering is disabled for RP logs. ([#46x])
- `RpLogs::Page` can be tested on its own, now that it requires `Forwardable`.

## [0.2.1] - 2015-10-26
### Fixed
- Lines whose contents are completely whitespace are parsed correctly ([#40x])

## [0.2.0] - 2015-10-26
### Added
- The RP log directory can now be renamed ([#15x])
- Two config options to control the inner workings of the plugin: ([#38x])
  - `max_seconds_between_posts` - for the time limit on post merges
  - `ooc_start_delimiters` - for what characters denote the start of OOC text ([#25x])
- `splits_by_character` setting to correctly handle clients that don't split by word ([#23x])
- Informational messages when converting RPs (can be quieted using Jekyll's config settings) ([#31x])
- Unit tests for most files, making development a lot easier
- `time_line` option to allow RPs to be custom sorted inside arcs
- Set up code linting with [RuboCop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop)
- Set up [Travis CI testing](https://travis-ci.org/xiagu/jekyll-rp_logs) and code coverage + [CodeClimate](https://codeclimate.com/github/xiagu/jekyll-rp_logs) ([#18x])
- `!MERGE` flag to force lines to merge ([#8x])
- `!SPLIT` flag to force lines to stay separate  ([#7x])
- Rake task `deploy` to set up a development site ([#4x])
- Rake task `serve` to deploy and then serve a development site ([#4x])

### Changed
- Instead of just `(`, `[` now denotes OOC by default too ([#25x])
- Warnings when errors are encountered now use Jekyll's logger
- Switched to using a wrapper class, `Jekyll::RpLogs::Page`, instead of just raw `Jekyll::Page`
- `Parser` now has default values for some regular expression matchers that are commonly used:
  - `MODE`, `NICKS`, and `FLAGS`
- Double quotes are used (nearly) universally

### Removed
- `LogLine` is no longer an inner class of `Parser`. This will break any custom parsers written.
- Most methods of `RpLogGenerator` are private now, but this shouldn't break anything unless you were doing naughty things with it.

### Fixed
- Clients who split posts in the middle of words can be handled correctly now ([#23x])
- The RP log directory is renameable again ([#15x])
- You can actually turn off conversion now
- Special HTML characters are escaped in input text ([#11x])
- The time difference in merged lines needs to be non-negative
- Set required Ruby version to `~> 2.1` ([#32x])
